<h2 class="sans">THE O. W. VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Is it easy to become a dramatist?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> As easy as anything else.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the requisites?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A West-end theatre, a first-rate troupe of artists, a
trained audience, and a personality.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you mean by a trained audience?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> An assembly accustomed to accept everything as wit, and
to laugh at anything.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Would such a gathering consider it amusing for someone to
say "Flirting with one's husband is quite indelicate: it is like
washing one's clean linen in public"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; and would find much to admire in a dialogue
given over for something like ten minutes to an exhaustive
consideration of muffins.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And what do you mean by a personality?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> More or less&mdash;an <i>insouciant</i> manner, and a rather
startling button-hole.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Does the personality require a speech or a cigarette?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Neither now, as both have ceased to be the fashion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Given the requisites you have specified for creating a
dramatist, what is the product?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A trivial comedy for serious people.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why give a play such a title?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can a comedy occupying two or three hours in
representation be entirely trivial?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not to the members of the audience.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And are they serious people?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That depends upon the condition of their brains and their
capacity of enjoyment.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Does the trivial comedy require a plot?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nothing to speak of.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Or characterisation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, for the same kind of dialogue will do for all the
company&mdash;for London ladies, country girls, justices of the peace,
doctors of divinity, maid-servants, and confidential butlers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What sort of dialogue?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Inverted proverbs and renovated paradoxes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is this kind of dialogue entirely new?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not entirely, as something rather like it has been heard
at the Savoy for the last ten or twenty years.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But is it good enough for a British Public?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Quite good enough. They will laugh when a London lady
expresses surprise at finding flowers growing in the country, and roar
when they hear the retort, that plants are as common in the provinces
as people in town.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But surely this vein of sarcasm, satire, or whatever it
is, will some day be worked out. What can the dramatist then do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Act upon precedent, and try something else.</p>

<td class="left">Early on Tuesday a severe engagement took place between the
Japanese Fleet and the Chinese Flotilla, in which the Chinese
ironclads <i>Wi Ho Wi</i>, <i>Bang Tel Bang</i>, and <i>Bosh Lu
Rot</i> were sunk. The loss on the Japanese side was a cabin-boy
wounded. The Chinese prisoners amounted to 180,000 men.</td>
<td class="left1">The Chinese Fleet gave a good account of the Japanese Squadron on
Tuesday. The slaughter of the Japs was enormous, amounting to at least
40,000 sailors and 50,000 marines. There was no loss on the Chinese
side. Owing to a mistake the <i>Wi Ho Wi</i> lost a rope, the <i>Bang
Tel Bang</i> had her figure-head slightly damaged, and the <i>Bosh Lu
Rot</i> re-entered port just to have her deck repainted. The Japanese
lost several ironclads and all their torpedo-boats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">On Wednesday morning the Japanese landed and took all the forts,
and garrisoned the city, which is now completely in the hands of the
troops of the Taicoon.</td>
<td class="left1">On Wednesday an attack of 70,000 Japanese troops was repulsed with
great slaughter by the Chinese, and the invaders are now in active
retreat. The Chinese have not pursued them, from motives of an
entirely philanthropic character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">On Thursday the Japanese commenced a general bombardment of the
island, and blew up all the forts and sixty-seven powder magazines.
The Chinese loss is estimated at 36,000 men. The Japanese escaped
unscathed.</td>
<td class="left1">An artillery duel took place on Thursday between the Chinese
troops and the Japanese, in which the latter lost all their war
materiel and seventy-nine general officers. The casualty on the
Chinese side was one drummer-boy slightly wounded&mdash;sprain of the left
little toe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">On Friday the Japanese made their grand attack and took the island
by assault, and destroyed all the enemy's fleet, with the exception of
a gun-boat.</td>
<td class="left1">For a few minutes the Japanese secured a footing on the island,
but were soon induced to retreat. Many of the Chinese ironclads have
seen much service, but are still able to dispose of the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">The Chinese Fleet on Saturday was entirely at the mercy of the
Japanese, and the Admiral is soliciting for terms. A flag of truce is
floating from the remaining Chinese ironclad.</td>
<td class="left1">The Chinese Admiral during Saturday has wired to his
Government&mdash;"The Japanese, after one slight reverse, having lost all
heart, are now suing for peace. We shall be careful to guard the best
interests of the empire."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">On Sunday the Japanese consented to permit the Chinese Admiral and
sailors to unconditionally surrender, and have arranged to protect
them from the fury of the Chinese Government.</td>
<td class="left1">The Chinese Admiral (under Sunday's date) has wired to
Pekin&mdash;"Have come to arrangement with Japanese authorities. Shall not
return to Pekin. Good-bye. Those who have no other engagements are
going home to tea."</td>

<p class="center">"You have lofty ambitions and the artistic temperament."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). What on earth's a
sideboard-cloth? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, I've the very <i>thing!</i>
See&mdash;all worked in Russian stitch!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). I thought they were always quite
plain. And what's that queer sort of flap-thing for?</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> Oh, <i>that?</i> That's&mdash;a&mdash;to cover up the
spoons, and forks, and things; quite the latest fashion, <i>now</i>,
you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> (<i>with self-assertion</i>). I <i>have</i> noticed
it at several dinner-parties I've been to in society lately,
certainly. Still, I'm not sure that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> I always have them on my <i>own</i> sideboard
now&mdash;my husband won't <i>hear</i> of any others.... Then, I <i>may</i>
put this one in paper for you? fifteen-and-sixpence&mdash;thanks <i>so</i>
much! (<i>To her colleague, as</i> Mrs. N. <i>departs</i>.)
<span class="smcap">Connie</span>, I've got rid of that awful
nightgown case at <i>last!</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Maycup.</i> A&mdash;you <i>don't</i> happen to have a small bag
to hold a powder-puff, and so on, you know?</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> I <i>had</i> some very pretty ones; but I'm
afraid they're all&mdash;oh, no, there's just <i>one</i> left&mdash;crimson
velvet and real <i>passementerie</i>. (<i>She produces a bag.</i>) Too
trotty for words, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Maycup</i> (<i>tacitly admitting its trottiness</i>). But
then&mdash;that sort of purse-shape&mdash;&mdash; Could I get a small pair of folding
curling-irons into it, should you think, at a pinch?</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> You could get <i>anything</i> into it&mdash;at a
pinch. I've one myself which will hold&mdash;well, I can't tell you what it
<i>won't</i> hold! Half-a-guinea&mdash;so <i>many</i> thanks! (<i>To
herself, as</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Maycup</span> <i>carries off
her bag</i>.) What <i>would</i> the Vicar's wife say if she knew I'd
sold her church collection bag for <i>that!</i> But it's all in a good
cause! (<i>An</i> Elderly Lady <i>comes up</i>.) May I show you some
of these&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>The Elderly Lady.</i> Well, I was wondering if you had such a
thing as a good warm pair of sleeping socks: because, these bitter
nights, I do find I suffer so from cold in my feet.</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> (<i>with effusion</i>). Ah, then I can
<i>feel</i> for you&mdash;so do <i>I!</i> At least, I <i>used</i> to before
I tried&mdash;(<i>To herself.</i>) Where <i>is</i> that pair of thick
woollen driving-gloves? Ah, <i>I</i> know. (<i>Aloud.</i>)&mdash;these.
I've found them <i>such</i> a comfort!</p>

<p><i>The E. L.</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). They have rather a
queer&mdash;&mdash; And then they're divided at the ends, too.</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> Oh, haven't you seen <i>those</i> before? Doctors
consider them so much healthier, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>The E. L.</i> I daresay they are, my dear. But aren't
the&mdash;(<i>with delicate embarrassment</i>)&mdash;the separated parts rather
long?</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> Do you <i>think</i> so? They allow so much more
freedom, you see; and then, of course they'll shrink.</p>

<p><i>The E. L.</i> That's true, my dear. Well, I'll take a pair, as
you recommend them so strongly.</p>

<p><i>Miss de M.</i> I'm quite <i>sure</i> you'll never regret it!
(<i>To herself, as the</i> E. L. <i>retires, charmed</i>.) I'd give
<i>anything</i> to see the poor old thing trying to put them on!</p>

<p><i>Miss Mimosa Tendrill</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I do so
<i>hate</i> hawking this horrid old thing about! (<i>Forlornly, to</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Allbutt-Innett</span>.) I&mdash;I beg your pardon;
but <i>will</i> you give me ten and sixpence for this lovely
work-basket?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span></p>
<p><i>Mrs. Allbutt-Innett.</i> My good girl, let me tell you I've been
pestered to buy that identical basket at every bazaar I've set foot in
for the last twelvemonth, and how you can have the face to ask ten and
six for it&mdash;you must think I've more money than wit!</p>

<p><i>Miss Tendr.</i> (<i>abashed</i>). Well&mdash;<i>eighteenpence</i>
then? (<i>To herself, as</i> Mrs. A.-I. <i>closes promptly</i>.)
There, I've sold <i>something</i>, anyhow!</p>

<p><i>The Hon. Diana D'Autenbas</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It's rather
fun selling at a Bazaar; one can let oneself <i>go</i> so much more!
(<i>To the first man she meets.</i>) I'm sure you'll buy one of my
buttonholes&mdash;now <i>won't</i> you? If I fasten it in for you
myself?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cadney Rowser.</i> A button'ole, eh? Think I'm not classy
enough as I am?</p>

<p><i>Miss D'Aut.</i> I don't think <i>anyone</i> could accuse you of
not being "<i>classy</i>"; still, a flower would just give the
finishing-touch.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C. R.</i> (<i>modestly</i>). Rats!&mdash;if you'll pass the
freedom. But you've such a way with you that&mdash;there&mdash;'ow much?</p>

<p><i>Miss D'Aut.</i> Only five shillings. Nothing&mdash;to <i>you!</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. C. R.</i> Five bob? You're a artful girl, <i>you</i> are!
"<i>Fang de Seakale</i>," and no error! But I'm <i>on</i> it; it's
worth the money to 'ave a flower fastened in by such fair 'ands. I
won't 'owl&mdash;not even if you <i>do</i> run a pin into me.... What? You
ain't done a'ready! No <i>'urry</i>, yer know.... 'Ere, won't you come
along to the refreshment-stall, and 'ave a little something at my
expense. Do!</p>

<p><i>Miss D'Aut.</i> I think you must imagine you are talking to a
barmaid!</p>

<p><i>Mr. C. R.</i> (<i>with gallantry</i>). I on'y wish barmaids was
'alf as pleasant and sociable as <i>you</i>, Miss. But they're a
precious stuck-up lot, <i>I</i> can assure you!</p>

<p><i>Miss D'Aut.</i> (<i>to herself, as she escapes</i>). I suppose
one ought to put up with this sort of thing&mdash;for a charity!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Babbicombe</i> (<i>at the Toy Stall, to the Belle of the
Bazaar, aged three-and-a-half</i>). You <i>perfect</i> duck! You're

<h2>THE LEARNED WELSH GOAT.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Dame Ap-Asq-th loquitur</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Not</i> the Learned Pig, ladies and gentlemen, this time. Oh
dear no! I should think the public had had about enough of him for
some time to come, and&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I forgot! (<i>Aside: He'll have to be
trotted out again presently, so I'd better shut up, and not spoil the
market for</i> Misther <span class="smcap">O'Morley</span>.) As I was
saying, ladies and gentlemen, not the Learned Irish Pig, but the
Learned Welsh Goat!</p>

<p>A goat, you know, is a nimble creature, which, in a state of
nature, mounts pinnacles, and leaps from rock to rock, like the poor
gentleman in the <i>Contrabandista</i>. This one could climb a church
steeple, and balance itself on the weathercock&mdash;if permitted to do so.
Couldn't you, <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>? (<i>Aside: I hope the
blessed brute won't butt me. He's been a bit restive of late.</i>)</p>

<p>No, ladies and gentlemen, <i>Esmeralda's</i> goat was really not in
it with mine, for nimbleness and <i>nous</i>, much less the goat in
<i>Dinorah</i>. As to <i>Robinson Crusoe's</i> much talked of
animal&mdash;&mdash; Here, I say, <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>! <i>Crwych
llnwyddfohw ychonbompthyy kckonobommthygy!</i> That means, "Mind your
'p's' and 'q's'," ladies and gentlemen, or, in Welsh, "Mind your 'l's'
and 'y's.'" But <i>my</i> goat understands English quite well, as
you'll see presently, and, moreover, is not, as Lord
<span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> says most <i>other</i> members of
the Liberal Party are, floored by words of two syllables.
<span class="smcap">Taffy</span> is equal to <i>five</i>&mdash;at least!
Most Welsh words, you know, are in about twenty. At least, they
<i>look</i> so, to non-Welshers&mdash;I mean, non-Welshmen. (<i>Aside: Hope
they won't ask me what is the Welsh for "Ploughing the
Sands"!</i>)</p>

<p>Now, you see, ladies and gentlemen, here are sixteen letters,
scattered, "in pie," as it were, forming a word of five syllables,
which has been familiar in our mouths as "All the Year Round"&mdash;I mean
household words&mdash;of late. (<i>Aside: Indeed it has! And if they knew
what a bore it has become in Cabinet Councils and other places where
they squabble&mdash;&mdash; Well, no matter!</i>) Behold the letters, ladies and
gentlemen!</p>

<p class="center">M. B. L. E. A. T. I. S. H. D. I. S. S. E. N.T</p>

<p>Now, <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>, what can you make of
<i>that?</i> Watch him, ladies and gentlemen! Mark his sagacity! And
remember, it is all done by kindness! (<i>Aside: Yes, "by</i>
<span class="smcap">Cadwallader</span> <i>and all his goats," it
wouldn't do to try anything else with</i> this <i>animal, or we should
all be sprawling in no time!</i>)</p>

<p>Plbymbch y llnrnwtclfly, <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>! See, he
starts with "a big, big D." No profanity intended, I assure you. This
is a Noncomformist goat, and carries a conscience! D. I. S. Ah! that,
too, hath an ominous sound, <span class="smcap">Taff</span>! But
you're not through yet. E. S. T. A. B! How carefully, yet how confidently,
he picks them out. No hesitation, no indecision. Ah! Gallant Little
<span class="smcap">Taffy</span> knows his book!
D. I. S. E. S. T. A. B&mdash;&mdash; Well, and what's the <i>next</i> letter,
<span class="smcap">Taffy</span>?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Left spelling it out.</i></p>

<hr />

<h2>HARD TO (L. C.) C.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I crave your advice and
sympathy under the following circumstances. I have been of late
considerably perplexed as to which side I ought to support in the
forthcoming London County Council Election. Sometimes I have felt
drawn to the banner of Progressivism, at other times I have yearned to
embrace Moderateness, I do not say the Moderate Programme, because
there are so many. In my difficulty I saw an announcement that the
<i>Daily Chronicle</i> was about to become an illustrated paper in the
interest of the Progressives. Accordingly, last Monday I eagerly
bought the first copy of the newly-pictured paper, and found a
delightful feast for my eyes in a reproduction of a drawing by Sir
<span class="smcap">Edward Burne-Jones</span>. It was without doubt a
charming piece of work, and the printing was marvellously good. That
decided me&mdash;I threw in my lot with the Progressives without more
ado.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, that was only the commencement of the
difficulty. That very afternoon I met a friend who happened to be a
"Moderate" candidate. "I suppose I can reckon on your assistance,
old fellow?" was his greeting as he patted me familiarly on the back.
I explained to him that I had determined to vote Progressive. He asked
me why. For some time I tried to think of some reason which should
appear, on the face of it, conclusive. It ended in my being truthful,
and playing Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Burne-Jones</span>. Then
came the questions which have been ringing in my ears ever since.
"What on earth has that delightful picture to do with the question?
Why, I've got it myself and am having it framed for our drawing-room.
But why should it make you vote Progressive?" And that's just it&mdash;I
didn't know, and I don't know. Please can anyone tell me?</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Not I, but you, must now obey</p>

<p>When cold half numbs the tortured toes,</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span> have omitted
one thing that would have contributed to the full success of their
publication of <i>The Memoirs of the Duchesse de Gontaut</i>, done out
of the French by Mrs. <span class="smcap">W. Davis</span>. They ought
to have engaged the services of our E. T. R., who would have been
quite at home in illustrating the prehistoric peeps here opened. The
Duchesse was <i>gouvernante</i> to those she fondly styles the
"children of France" during the Restoration. Of her charges one was
"The Child of Miracle," born to the <span class="smcap">Duchesse de
Berry</span> after the murder of her husband. He was subsequently
known to French Royalists as <span class="smcap">Henri the
Fifth</span>, and to the rest of the world as the Comte
<span class="smcap">De Chambord</span>. What is amazing, in a sense
fascinating, to readers at this end of the century, is to find a state
of things existing in which such a poor, common-place, fatuous
creature as <span class="smcap">Charles the Tenth</span> could be
regarded with reverence, almost worship, by his fellow-creatures.
Madame <span class="smcap">De Gontaut</span>, a high-minded,
well-educated, sensible woman, almost weeps over the king as in the
days of July, 1830, he sat on the balcony at the Palace of St. Cloud
playing whist, the game interrupted from time to time by the sound of
the tocsin, and the flashing forth of fresh fires in the streets of
revolted Paris. On the 28th of July overtures were made from the
revolutionary committee in Paris, which might, temporarily at least,
have saved the throne had the king accepted their moderate conditions.
"I think," he said, for all response, "it is a great impertinence to
bring me such propositions." Three days later, at two o'clock in the
morning, the king was roused out of his peaceful sleep, and packed off
to Dieppe by friends, anxious to save him from the fate of
<span class="smcap">Louis the Sixteenth</span>.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title">Extracted from the Diary of
Toby, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, February 11.</i>&mdash;The other day
rumour about that <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span>, weary of
strife, finding how sharper than a serpent's tooth is the enmity of
parted friends, had resolved to retire from political life. That news,
if true, would eclipse the gaiety of Parliament.
<span class="smcap">Tim's</span> manner may not be precisely described
as gay. It is, in truth, somewhat saturnine; rather raspy,
occasionally vitriolic. If there is any instruction to be conveyed,
<span class="smcap">Tim</span> approves the fashion of the ancient
Israelitish captain, who "taught the men of Succoth with thorns of the
wilderness and briars." <span class="smcap">Tim's</span> former
colleagues, now ranged under modest leadership of
<span class="smcap">John Redmond</span>, are, he conscientiously
believes, much in need of instruction. So to-night
<span class="smcap">Tim</span> "taught them" with thorns of the
wilderness and briars.</p>

<p>A brisk debate, falling into most attractive sequence. This in
measure accidental; looked like admirable stage management. First
<span class="smcap">John Redmond</span>, with his neatly-moulded
phrases, his assumption of profound statecraft, his assertion that
Tories please him not, nor Liberals either; his conclusion that since
Government are on friendly terms with the major Irish Party, the minor
(nine strong) will march into lobby with <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span>, whom they used to hate, and
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span> of Birmingham, whom they scarcely
love. Next <span class="smcap">John Morley</span>, stirred to
unusually profound depths, his speech glowing above the unwonted fire.
Then <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>, gracefully skating on
exceedingly thin ice, incidentally dropping into imagery on successive
phases of the married state, which House, ever alert for personal
references, listened to with quickened interest. A scholar's current
speech or writing is insensibly tinctured with flavour of his latest
study. Odd that just now <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>
should display this curiously minute knowledge and appreciation of
various phases of married life as it is to be studied in books of
reference.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="smcap">Tim</span>, his truculence tempered by
humour of the situation. <span class="smcap">John Redmond</span>
protested he had made no bargain with Opposition in transferring to
them his handful of votes. <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>
had confirmed disclaimer. Too much for tender-hearted
<span class="smcap">Tim</span>. Tears glistened in his eyes; his voice
trembled; his hand shook; his body seemed to grow limp, as he lamented
this last degeneration of ancient Irish spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span></p>
<p>"I have," he said, "been in alliance with the Tory Party before
now, and may be again; but I know of no occasion when any Irish party
gave their votes unless they got something for them."</p>

<p>That only <span class="smcap">Tim's</span> fun. Overcoming his
emotion, he, with ruthless force, pitiless logic, laid bare position
of the new Party of the Muses.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Parnellite Amendment, supported by
Unionists, negatived by 256 against 236.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;If you want to make your flesh creep, you should
have heard the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> just now challenging
the Lord Mayor of Dublin, whom he discovered standing at Bar; and, as
Sir <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span> adds, "not drinking."
Lord Mayor got up in gorgeous apparel; scarlet gown, ermine-tipped,
with gold chain gleaming across manly chest. Recalls days of
yesteryear when <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> was Lord Mayor of
Dublin. Being also Member for an Irish constituency, no autocratic
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> might challenge his right to cross
the Bar, whether in civilian dress, or in robes of office. On
occasions when he had a petition to deliver he came down, cloaked, in
a four-wheeler. Made the heart of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cove</span>
in Members' cloak-room stand still, when he suddenly threw back his
wraps, and disclosed glittering garb beneath. Sat on front bench below
gangway with inadequate legs partially crossed, his chain mysteriously
clanking, motion understood at time to serve double purpose of calling
attention to Lord Mayor's presence, and of hinting at the kind of bond
that held Ireland to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Present Lord Mayor of Dublin, not being a Member had to sue for
admission at door of House. Word passed to Sergeant-at-Arms; gallant
officer, having heard something of Irish habits, observed precaution
of shouldering mace before he went out to confront the strangers. If
they had shillelaghs, the mace, twirled about by lusty arms, might be
reckoned on to keep the gate. The messengers not behind in military
precaution; hauled out the bar&mdash;the veritable Bar of House of Commons
of which we hear so much and see so little.</p>

<p>"Now," said the oldest Messenger, folding his arms and clenching
his teeth, "let them do their worst."</p>

<p>Sergeant-at-Arms marched in, mace on shoulder, escorting Lord Mayor
and two sheriffs. If they had meant mischief they thought better of it
on looking round. Lord Mayor might, it is true, if he were in good
condition have vaulted over bar or ducked beneath it, and run amuck up
floor. But then the sheriffs, before they could have imitated him,
would have been awfully mauled with the mace.</p>

<p>Any piratical mention that may have lurked in minds of the
insurgents was finally crushed by really awful tone in which the
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, fixing glittering eye on group at
bar, said, "My Lord Mayor of Dublin, what have you there?"</p>

<p>Members expected trembling culprit would produce from under his
cloak the horse-pistol, dagger, cup of poison, or whatever he may have
brought with him with felonious intent. But he meekly answered, "A
petition." This he unfolded, and as he showed a disposition to read it
through, Members went off.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Another day passed talking round Address.
<span class="smcap">Naoroji</span> moved Amendment raising question of
financial relations between England and India. Read a paper of
prodigious length; beat the tom-tom for nearly an hour. "In churches,"
said the (almost) Reverend <span class="smcap">Jemmy Lowther</span>,
"an incumbent sometimes reads himself in.
<span class="smcap">Naoroji</span> reads his congregation out. Mayn't
be quite so black as the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> painted
him, but he's quite as long-winded as could have been expected."</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;New Session not quite a fortnight old, and lo! a
strange thing has happened. Electric bells struck&mdash;I mean they won't
strike. When, just now, House cleared for division on Amnesty motion
electric knobs touched as usual. Thereupon should have followed
tintinnabulation of the bells in all the rooms and corridors outside
the Chamber. Only little tinkle heard; sort of weird mocking laugh,
"Ha! ha!" and then silence.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/096.png"><img src="images/096-500.png" width="500" height="448" alt="Labby's Share." /></a>
<p class="center">Labby's Share.</p>
</div>

<p>Consequences might have been serious. Last thing well-trained
Member regards as absolute preliminary to voting is to sit throughout
the debate. Scattered far and wide, in library, tea-room, dining-room,
or smoking-room, when they hear the bell they rush in to vote. If they
don't hear it they stop where they are. Difficulty temporarily
overcome by sending policemen and messengers bawling along all the
passages, "Division! division!" This all very well for the moment; but
what is to be done about the bells?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Rollit</span>, steeped in parliamentary
usages, says, "If the bells won't obey the
<span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> order, send them to the Clock
Tower."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stuart</span> promptly places at disposal of
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> a squadron of <i>Star</i> boys, to
run about premises on given signal and proclaim division. "They'd do
it much better than the policemen and messengers," he says.</p>

<p>True; but as Colonel <span class="smcap">Legge</span> apprehends,
they would be certain in excitement of moment, instead of calling out
"Division," to lapse into more familiar cry, "Hextra Speshul!" That
would never do. Simplest plan is to stop this interminable talk round
the Address and get to work. When the electric bells shut up in sheer
disgust at waste of time, grown-up men of business may be expected to
reconsider the position.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tim Harrington</span>
talked for two hours and five minute about ancient history of
Maamtrasna.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Much murmuring below Gangway just now because to
programme of Session already overloaded Government decline to add Bill
providing for payment of Members. <span class="smcap">Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate</span> been observed to regard this topic with smiling
equanimity. Secret of his content now disclosed. Papers report how
Spanish merchant, resident in Barcelona, having studied
<span class="smcap">Sage's</span> public Parliamentary career, begs
leave, as trifling indication of his esteem and admiration, to be
permitted to pay <span class="smcap">Sage's</span> election expenses
whenever incurred.</p>

<p>"'Tis a pretty variation on Spanish devotional habit," says
<span class="smcap">Plunket</span>, who has followed
<span class="smcap">Borrow's</span> footsteps in Spain, "More
especially in rural districts, pious men approach the shrine of
favourite saint and hang upon it an offering, peradventure poor in
intrinsic value, but rich in proportion to their revenues. Expect
by-and-by the <span class="smcap">Sage</span> will be canonised, and
straying by the banks of the Guadalquivir, you shall here and there
come upon shrines to Saint <span class="smcap">Labby</span>, rich with
votive offerings."</p>

<p>"That may be so," said <span class="smcap">Gorst</span>. "You're
always ready to take the poetic view of a thing. But I'd like to wait
and see the colour of the money. You know the
<span class="smcap">Sage</span> has long been firing away at
enterprising traders in Spain who, usually dating their missives from
a State prison, offer for a slight consideration to disclose fabulous
stores of hidden wealth. The <span class="smcap">Sage</span> has
spoiled their little game. Should like to be quite sure they've not
broken out in a new place, and are trying it on first with the
<span class="smcap">Sage</span>."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Set-to between the Birmingham Cock and the
Yorkshire-cum-Fifeshire Bantam. Odds at first in favour of the
veteran. Admitted on both sides the young 'un beat him hollow.</p>

<h2>QUIET RUBBERS.</h2>

<p>Off to Olympia&mdash;greatest show on earth&mdash;with wife; also with
<span class="smcap">Bob</span> and <i>his</i> wife. Find the two
ladies wearing goloshes&mdash;"rubbers" they call them&mdash;say "they've just
read in the paper that they are universal in America in winter."
Annoyed. Never knew my wife's feet were as large as they seem now.
<span class="smcap">Bob</span> defends goloshes&mdash;hypocrite! Says
"nothing wets feet like snow, and at any moment we may be in for the
greatest <i>snow</i> on earth." Stupid joke, considering that a good
boot will keep out anything. Why shouldn't the ladies leave their
rubbers <i>outside</i> show, in cloak-room&mdash;as people do in mosques in
the East? Would be quite in keeping with the "Orient." Ladies say
they'll be lost&mdash;a good job if they were! Getting quite sulky, when
BOB suggests dinner. Good dinner! Excellent wines! Wife's feet don't
look as large now. Why doesn't everybody wear g'loshes? Old Greeks
must have worn 'em&mdash;don't we read of the "Goloshus of Rhodes?" Old
Romans, too, or why did they call <i>their</i> Olympia the Golosheum?
BOB says they didn't. I say they did! Disturbance. Wonder who's making
it? Turn 'em out! They're turning <i>me</i> out! Won't go&mdash;send for
<span class="smcap">Kiralfy</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Goloshy
Kiralfy</span>&mdash;there's the word again!
<span class="smcap">Goloshy</span> <i>must</i> wear rubbers. People
trying to pacify me. Won't let 'em. Back home. Wife crying. What for?
Says she will never go out in rubbers again! Yes, she shall. So will
I. Put 'em on now!&mdash;To bed in rubbers.</p>
